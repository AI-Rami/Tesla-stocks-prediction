Overview

- Dataset: TSLA.csv (Tesla stock price history)
- Goal: Predict future closing prices using historical data
- Workflow:
  - Data cleaning and transformation
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature selection
  - Train/test split
  - Regression modeling (Random Forest Regressor)
  - Model evaluation (MSE, RÂ²)
